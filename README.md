This project models the website of an interior lighting company that allows users to purchase items and add them to a shopping cart. The shopping cart will update the number of items in the cart as well as the total cost of all items. An increment and decrement button is available for each item so the user does not have to manually type their desired quantity.

When the user clicks on the shopping cart an animation slides it into view to display its full contents.

Made using functional components in React. The goal for this project was to practice the useState hook, as well as React Router to handle multiple pages on the website.
