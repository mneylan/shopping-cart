This project models the website of an interior lighting company that allows users to purchase items and add them to a shopping cart. The shopping cart will update the number of items in the cart as well as the total cost of all items. 

Made using functional components in React. The goal in making this was to practice the useState hook, as well as React Router to handle multiple pages on the website.
